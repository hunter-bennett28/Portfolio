#StudentLoanCalculator

###Description:
A Java Swing interface that allows for input and storage of student information as well as loan payment calculations.

###Usage:
Students can be added from the left panel while right panel is for calculations.
CSL and OSL can be entered manually but will be populated automatically when you enter a new student.
Current Prime Interest Rate is a decimal number that only accepts increments of 0.25. The above three parameters as well as Amortization Period must be populated for calculations.

###Warning:
Eclipse has a bug with Swing that forces user to resize the window before interface will show.
